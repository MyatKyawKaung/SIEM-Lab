**Sysmon** is a system monitoring tool developed by Microsoft. It is used to provide detailed information from various telemetry about system processes, network activity, and file system changes. Sysmon can be used to detect and investigate malicious activity, such as malware infections, privilege escalation, and data exfiltration.

### If you want to learn more about `Sysmon` capabilities, you can go to Microsoft documentation.

### Before we install our `sysmon`, we need to download configuration file for `sysmon` . The configuration file I will be using is created by [olafhartong](https://github.com/olafhartong).

Go to https://github.com/olafhartong/sysmon-modular repository, and search for sysmonconfig.xml

### Right-Click and Save as `.xml` format

### Open PowerShell as an administrator and go to the same directory as extracted `sysmon` executable file lives. (Mine is C:\Users\MKK_Windows\Desktop\Sysmon\Sysmon)

```
cd ` C:\Users\MKK_Windows\Desktop\Sysmon\Sysmon`
dir
```
