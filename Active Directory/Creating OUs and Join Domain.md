### In this demo, I will create users and groups in our Active Directory environment and join our Windows VM machine to the domain.

On`Server Manager`, click on `Tools` at the top of the corner OR `Windows+R` > `dsa.msc`

![image01](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a8041bf7-ae34-469a-aadf-381884ee8e4a)

Select `Active Directory Users and Computes` ( This is where we can create Organizational Units-OU and Group Policy Objects-GPO )

![image02](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e1fae938-2f54-496e-9b11-ed3b1cf13f67)


You can see the default OUs (Builtin, Computers, Users, etc) 

![image03](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8a886f21-d50c-4b21-967d-547ef9c5bb4f)

![image05](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a8ae2f15-96fe-4186-aad9-571c10287733)


We will create a new user named `Kyaw Gyi`in our `SOC Team` OU. Select `SOC Team` > right-click `New` > `User`

![image06](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/180fc944-2eed-4d08-9459-d5cb05ff1697)

Give a password and uncheck `User must change password at next logon` for this lab.

![image08](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/66dc69e6-8455-4b5f-a1a7-511c4a7e17a6)

Press `Finish`

![image09](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c8f0efaf-7aec-48c6-8ce5-e0bd1ee5dea8)

New User `Kyaw Gyi`is created in SOC Team.

![image10](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/735ff237-b417-4868-a5df-52f2cc299ab6)

### For `Detection Engineering Team`, I will create using PowerShell cmdlets

```markdown
#Create OU
New-ADOrganizationalUnit -Name "Detection Engineering Team" -Path "DC=TheRadiant,DC=local"

#Create User
New-ADUser -Name "Myat Kyaw Kaung" -SamAccountName "myatkyawkaung" -Path "OU=Detection Engineering Team,DC=TheRadiant,DC=local" -AccountPassword(Read-Host -AsSecureString "Input Password") -Enabled $true -ChangePasswordAtLogon $false
```
![image11](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d6d090d1-00cb-4927-bab0-1a182127f00d)

You can see User `Myat Kyaw Kaung` was created in `Detection Engineering Team`

## Step 4 Join Windows host to Domain

On your Windows host, Right-click on the "Start" button or press the `Windows key + X` > select `System`

![image13](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/207e3f90-0a2d-48f3-bde7-6555764bd733)

Got to `Advanced system settings`

![image14](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f99ade69-ece6-4406-a644-03f8a1c2e76a)

In Computer Name tab, press `Change`

![image15](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/846dbb0d-3874-4d35-b1b7-29584c674e95)

Select `Domain`  and enter your domain name.

![image16](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2a0efdf1-0987-416d-a03a-106d691cd0ab)

In this case error pops up because DNS resolver in my Windows host cannot resolve `TheRadiant.local` domain. So, we will need to change the DNS Server.

We can do this by changing our DNS server to our AD serverâ€™s IP. 

`Windows+R` > `ncap.cpl`

![image17](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/044cdb13-66c1-469d-b07d-1717a2375213)</br>
![image18](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5e5b1a57-342c-4423-8bde-1f9a912ecb65)
![image19](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f045fc20-519c-4823-bc4b-9d9e7e17dac1)

Enter your Windows Server IP address as shown in figure

![image20](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9f699f68-6106-483d-8150-5606060cacce)

Now we can join to our domain using administrator credentials.

![image21](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fe8d4ed5-246e-4b17-8fed-236e0e634a3c)
![image22](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ec5c86ed-932a-44c3-9ce6-c7dcd4b53b92)

You will be prompted to restart. Click ok and restart your Windows host.

![image23](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8e1c2c84-5808-4aed-acfd-6cf0801dee7b)

Once restarted, clicked `Other user` and sign in to your domain with your newly created users from our previous steps.
