**In this demo, I will create custom dashboards in Splunk to monitor and detect suspicious activities in our environment.**

### Dashboard 1: User Login Activity Monitoring Dashboard

**The primary objective of this dashboard is to visualize the success and failure rates of user login activities. We'll focus on key metrics like total login attempts, successful logins and failed logins by filtering with `EventID=4624` (Account Logon) and `EventID=4625` (Account Logoff)**

Firstly, we will need to find out successful login accounts by using SPL query. The following query will show all unique successful authenticated accounts within last 7days.

```markdown
index=windows EventCode=4624 | stats count by Account_Name | sort -count
```

There are some machine accounts and service accounts which we will need to whitelist for less noise. This can be done by removing machine and service accounts using following query

```markdown
index=windows EventCode=4624
| rex field=Account_Name "(?<User_Account>^[^$]+)$"
| search NOT User_Account IN ("SYSTEM", "LOCAL SERVICE", "NETWORK SERVICE", "-")
| search NOT User_Account="DWM-*"
| search NOT User_Account="UMFD-*"
| stats count by User_Account
| sort -count
| head 10
```

After whitelisting, results become more accurate with less noise. We can now save this query as a dashboard. 

Go to `Save As` tab, on the right corner and save the query as `New Dashboard`

Give title for your dashboard and configure settings as your preferences.

On your Splunk App, you will see a new dashboard weâ€™ve just created.

You can configure dashboards in a visually more presentable format such as piecharts and columns on the right corner of the panel.

We can create dashboards for authentication failure activities by modifying our previous query with `EventId=4625` 

```markdown
index=windows EventCode=4625
| rex field=Account_Name "(?<User_Account>^[^$]+)$"
| search NOT User_Account IN ("SYSTEM", "LOCAL SERVICE", "NETWORK SERVICE", "-")
| search NOT User_Account="DWM-*"
| search NOT User_Account="UMFD-*"
| stats count by User_Account
| sort -count
| head 10
```

### Dashboard 2: Web Traffic Anomaly Dashboard

**The primary objective of this dashboard is to visualize excessive web traffic and identify suspicious user agents. We'll focus on metrics like total web traffic, unique IP addresses, top user agents, and potential anomalies.**
